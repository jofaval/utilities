# Utilities #

Some utilities I've made along the way, resourceful to me, but maybe for somebody else too, hopefully.

## Python

An easy and fast to develop in language that's proven to be very useful, specially because of it's libraries.

### Developed

- [ascii-to-text.py](./python/ascii-to-text.py), it does as it says, given ascii codes it returns a text, and viceversa.
- [store-folder-state.py](./python/store-folder-state.py), prints all of the folders, with the option for recursiveness, into a txt as a sort of snapshot of a given folder
- [specificity.py](./python/specificity.py), utility functions to ease the pain of CSS specificity.

## Javascript

The langauge by default for user interacion in the web.

### Developed

- [specificity.js](./javascript/specificity.js), the same python utility, but in javascript
